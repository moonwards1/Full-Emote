You can easily use it to highlight parts of your chat. Imagine pointing in the direction of the place one is talking about.


This project uses Git LFS

This is a git LFS repository. Before cloning, ensure you have Git LFS installed. Get it here - https://git-lfs.github.com/

Software packages like GitHub Desktop or GitKraken should automatically clone all the pointers for LFS files, and then pull the ones you need when you checkout a branch.

If that doesn't happen, in a terminal enter this: git-lfs fetch

and after that's done enter:
git-lfs checkout .

That will pull all LFS files.
